# Changing variables:

## `=`, `+=`, `-=`, string accumulation

**Exercises to become familiar with variable reassignment, assignment operators and accumulation.**

1. Declare a variable called name. Assign a string value. Print to screen. 

2. Print to screen that name with a "Schm" in front of it. 

3. What value does name have now? Comment your answer and then print name to screen to test. 

4. Assign another string value to name. Print to screen. Comment why name has now had two different values.

5. Declare a variable called coffee. Assign it a numeric value. 

6. Print to screen a string that tells us x regularly drinks y cups of coffee per day. 

7. Declare a variable called daysBeforeExam. Assign it a numeric value. 

8. Print to screen a string that tells us x drinks y cups of coffee with n days before exam.

9. Making use of `+=` and `-=`, print to screen a string that has x drinking one more cup of coffee, with (n - 1) less days before exam. 
 
10. What value do coffee and daysBeforeExam currently have? Comment your answer, then print to screen the variables to test. 

11. Review variable values throughout code. 

## concat()

**Another way to accumulate or "concatenate" strings.**

12. Declare a variable called schmozzler. Assign it a string value of "Schm". 

13. Using the concat() function, print to screen the name variable linked to schmozzler. 

14. What value does name have now? Comment your answer and then print name to screen to test.
