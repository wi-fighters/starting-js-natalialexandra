# Name Analyzer
## Use string methods to complete the task! 

Create a program that declares a variable name, and assign a string value to that variable.

Assuming that the value `Winston` is assigned to `name`, when the program is run, it should print out:

```
Hello Winston.
Your name is 7 letters long.
The first letter of your name is W, the last is n.
If I wanted to be funny, I would call you Winschmoo.
```

**Bonus**:

* Try to change the name value, to a string that contains spaces e.g. `Winston Churchill`. Is the analysis still correct? If not, try to solve this problem with the program.

* What if we change the name value so that it begins or ends with a space? If there is a problem, try to find a way to overcome it.
