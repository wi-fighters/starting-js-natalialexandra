The Puppy Age Calculator

You know how old your dog is in human years, but what about dog years? Calculate it!
    Write a function named calculateDogAge that:
        takes 1 argument: your puppy's age (in human years).
        calculates your dog's age based on the conversion rate of 1 human year to 7 dog years.
        outputs the result to the screen like so: "Your doggie is NN years old in dog years!"
    Call the function three times with different sets of values.
    Bonus: Add an additional argument to the function that takes the conversion rate of human to dog years.

/**

function calculateDogAge(ageDog) {
  let agePuppyInDogAge = ageDog * 7;
