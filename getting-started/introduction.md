## Console.logging & Data Types! 

### 1. Vars & console.log() 
Declare a variable called `firstName` and assign your first name to that variable. Do they same with your last name. Print both variables. NOTE: When printing two variables, separate the variables with a comma (,) in the console log e.g.
```javascript 
console.log(variable1, variable2);
```

### 2. Variable Info!
Make a profile of someone's information. Store all the information in variables eg. `name`, `city`, `job` etc. (five variables total) Console log the variables.

### 3. Concatenation
Print the sentence `John Smith is a 43 year old teacher who lives in Berlin` using variables (where possible) and text. You can combine variables with text in the console by using the plus symbol (+) e.g. 
```javascript
console.log("this is a " + variable);
```

### 4. Data Types
Copy and paste these variables into your JavaScript file. Write down which type you think each variable is. Check your answers by printing the types to the console.

### 7. Compare and contrast
Declare three variables: `a`, `b`, `c`. Assign numbers to each of the variables. Check if the variable values are equal or not e.g. 
```javascript
console.log(a === b);
``` 
Do this for each possibility (a, b) (a, c), (b, c). Then, print the data type of this check to the console.
